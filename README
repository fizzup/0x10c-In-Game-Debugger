IGD - a 0x10c In Game Debugger

This is an in-game disassembler and debugger for the DCPU-16 CPU in 0x10c. It
currently runs in the emulated CPU in the DCPU-16 Studio available at
http://badsector.github.com/dcpustud/downloads.html.

To run the debugger, you need to start it at a particular function, by pushing
the address of the function on the stack, and calling the function "debugger".

The debugger will then single-step through the code. There isn't any support
for arbitrary breakpoints yet.

The label ":break_point_vector" must be at an address that is less than 0x20.
This is needed so that the breakpoint code is one word long.
